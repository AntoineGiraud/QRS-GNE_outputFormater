# QRSII & GNE output data formater

The output of QRS & GNE isn't quite handy to be directly put into excel or other web app.

This scripts extracts the data from GNE.dta & QRS output and formats it into .csv & .json

**GNE** stands for *General Network Editor*. It enables you to create a network based on nodes and links.  
**QRSII** stands for *Quick Response System*. It enables you to perform a [sequential four-step model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_forecasting#Four-step_models) based on the .dat files created by GNE.
